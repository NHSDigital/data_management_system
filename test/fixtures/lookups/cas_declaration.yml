  value: I confirm that I need the 'level of access' and the selected datasets that
    require special permission identified in section 3.2 in order to deliver the work
    described in section 3.1. I confirm I will make sure that projects using Celtic
    data are discussed with the Celtic registries and that enough time is given to
    allow them the opportunity to comment on any output produced prior to its publication.
